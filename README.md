# The-KFC-Diet-Problem

Linear Programming Model using Python

There are many diet plans. Each diet has different limits for carbs, sodium, fiber etc. Typically, those diets impose some additional constraints to a regular diet so as to help people reach their goals (mainly weight loss).  This project aims to create a diet that would feed a family of four (by satisfying nutritional requirements while minimizing Weight Watcher points) using the KFC menu.
